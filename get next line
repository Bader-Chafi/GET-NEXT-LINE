// With BUFFER_SIZE = 1, you read the file one character at a time. This ensures that your program processes each character individually and stops as soon as it encounters a newline (\n).

// It Matches the Return Type of read:
//              The read function in C returns the number of bytes read as a ssize_t value. This ensures bytes_read can directly store the result of read without type mismatches.
// ssize_t is a standard type specifically designed to handle sizes or counts of data. It ensures your code works consistently across different systems.
